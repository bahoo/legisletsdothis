4. Buttons to email this template message to legislators.

### Installation

```

[legisletsdothis]

Dear [ LEGISLATOR FIRST NAME ],

Hi, I'm a constituent of yours in the [ LEGISLATIVE DISTRICT ] district.

I strongly support banning @DonaldTrump from Twitter.

I appreciate your consideration.

Thank you,

[ YOUR NAME ]
